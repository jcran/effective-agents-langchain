# Effective AI Agent Patterns with LangChain

A collection of proven patterns for building effective AI agents using LangChain and LangGraph. These patterns demonstrate different approaches to agent architecture, from simple tool usage to complex autonomous systems. These patterns are based on the Anthropic blog post ["Building Effective AI Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run any pattern
python effective_agent_patterns_langchain/0-augmented-llm.py
```

**Key Features:**
- Task planning and decomposition
- Parallel task execution
- Result aggregation

**Use Cases:**
- Complex project management
- Multi-step research tasks
- Coordinated analysis

**Pattern:** `Plan ‚Üí Assign ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Aggregate`

---

### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern
**File:** `5-evaluator-optimizer.py`

**What it does:** Iteratively improves content through evaluation and refinement.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-perspective evaluation
- Structured feedback loops
- Quality scoring systems
- Iterative improvement

**Use Cases:**
- Content quality improvement
- Writing enhancement

### 6. Autonomous Agents Pattern
**File:** `6-autonomous-agents.py`

**What it does:** Creates self-directed agents that pursue goals independently.

**Key Features:**
- Goal-oriented behavior
- State management with LangGraph
- Decision-making loops
- Tool usage planning

**Use Cases:**
- Independent research tasks
- Shopping assistants
- Automated workflows

**Pattern:** `Goal ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Continue/Complete`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Modern LangChain Updates

This project uses the latest LangChain patterns:

- ‚úÖ `create_react_agent()` instead of deprecated `initialize_agent()`
- ‚úÖ `@tool` decorator from `langchain_core.tools`
- ‚úÖ Proper async support with `ainvoke()`
- ‚úÖ Structured outputs with Pydantic models
- ‚úÖ LangGraph for complex agent workflows

### Dependencies

```toml
dependencies = [
    "langchain-core",      # Core abstractions
    "langchain-community", # Community integrations  
    "langchain-openai",    # OpenAI integration
    "langchain",           # Main package + hub
    "langgraph"           # Graph-based agent framework
]
```

## üéØ When to Use Each Pattern

| Pattern | Complexity | Use Case | Best For |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Augmented LLM** | Low | Tool integration | Simple Q&A with tools |
| **Prompt Chaining** | Low-Medium | Sequential workflows | Content creation |
| **Routing** | Low | Cost optimization | Multi-model systems |
| **Parallelization** | Medium | Performance | Bulk processing |
| **Orchestrator** | Medium-High | Task coordination | Complex projects |
| **Evaluator-Optimizer** | High | Quality improvement | Content refinement |
| **Autonomous** | High | Independent operation | Goal-driven agents |

## üö¶ Getting Started Guide

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `0-augmented-llm.py` to understand basic tool usage
2. **Add Workflow**: Try `1-prompt-chaining.py` for multi-step processes  
3. **Optimize Performance**: Use `3-parallelization.py` for concurrent processing
4. **Scale Complexity**: Move to `4-orchestrator.py` for coordinated tasks
5. **Advanced Applications**: Explore `6-autonomous-agents.py` for independent agents

## üí° Best Practices

- **Start with the simplest pattern** that meets your needs
- **Use async patterns** for performance-critical applications

## üìà Migration from Legacy LangChain

If migrating from older LangChain code:

- Replace `initialize_agent()` ‚Üí `create_react_agent()`
- Update imports: `langchain.tools` ‚Üí `langchain_core.tools`
- Use `.invoke()` instead of `.run()`
- Consider migrating to LangGraph for complex workflows
